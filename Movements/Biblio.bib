  abstract={Massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are very popular in China, which provides a potential platform for scientific research. We study the online-offline activities of avatars in an MMORPG to understand their game-playing behavior. The statistical analysis unveils that the active avatars can be classified into three types. The avatars of the first type are owned by game cheaters who go online and offline in preset time intervals with the online duration distributions dominated by pulses. The second type of avatars is characterized by a Weibull distribution in the online durations, which is confirmed by statistical tests. The distributions of online durations of the remaining individual avatars differ from the above two types and cannot be described by a simple form. These findings have potential applications in the game industry.}

    abstract = {The scalability of large-scale networked virtual environments (NVEs) such as today's massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) faces inherent limits imposed by client-server architectures. We identify an emerging research direction that applies peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in order to realize more scalable and affordable NVEs. The central issue for P2P-based NVE (P2P-NVE) systems is to correctly and efficiently maintain the topology of all participating peers by solving the neighbor discovery problem. We also propose the Voronoi-based overlay network (VON), a simple and efficient design that maintains the P2P topology in a fully-distributed, low-latency, and message-efficient manner. Simulation results show that by bounding the per-node resource consumption, VON can be fundamentally more scalable than existing methods while achieving high topology consistency and reliability},
