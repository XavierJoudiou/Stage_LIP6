******README******
This program generates realistic traces of MMOG-avatars
according to the model desribed in the file RR-Inria.pdf.
Please see the doc directory for the project javadoc.

All model parameters are set through the configuration file
"model.cfg". 
These parameters are:
densityZoneSize : The size of a density zone
avatarNb        : The number of avatars 
tickInterval    : The time interval between two trace steps
mapSize         : The size of the edge of the map (the map is square)
randomSeed      : The random seed used for all probabilistic operations
densityZoneNb   : The number of density zones
zoneDistributionLaw : The avatar distribution law inside hotspots (may be ZIPF or GAUSSIAN)
maxTravelSpeed : The maximum speed while travelling
maxExploreSpeed : The maximum speed while exploring
acceleration : The acceleration
avatarsInDesertZones : The number of avatars located in desert zones
simulationEndtime : The end time of the simulation

### Behavioral State Machine transition probabilities ###
There are three states in the State Machine: Halt, Travel and Wander
The transition are named as follows: (InitialState)2(DestinationState)
ie., a transition from state Halt to state Travel is called h2t.
The transition probabilities are given as a number N between 0 and 10000,
and the real probabilities will be computed as N/10000.
Ten transition probabilities have to be assigned.
They are:

h2h
h2t
h2w
w2h
w2t
w2w
cwd
t2h
t2w
t2t
