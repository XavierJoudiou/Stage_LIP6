	abstract = {{M}assively {M}ultiplayer {O}nline {G}ames ({MMOG}s) recently emerged as a popular class of applications with millions of users. {T}o offer acceptable gaming experience, such applications need to render the virtual world surrounding the player with very low latency. {H}owever, current state-of-the-art {MMOG}s based on peer-to-peer overlays fail to satisfy these requirements. {T}his happens because avatar mobility implies many data exchanges through the overlay. {A}s state-of-the-art overlays do not anticipate this mobility, the needed data is not delivered on time, which leads to transient failures at the application level. {T}o solve this problem, we propose {B}lue {B}anana, a mechanism that models and predicts avatar movement, allowing the overlay to adapt itself by anticipation to the {MMOG} needs. {O}ur evaluation is based on large-scale traces derived from {S}econd life. {I}t shows that our anticipation mechanism decreases by 20% the number of transient failures with only a network overhead of 2%.},

  abstract={Massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are very popular in China, which provides a potential platform for scientific research. We study the online-offline activities of avatars in an MMORPG to understand their game-playing behavior. The statistical analysis unveils that the active avatars can be classified into three types. The avatars of the first type are owned by game cheaters who go online and offline in preset time intervals with the online duration distributions dominated by pulses. The second type of avatars is characterized by a Weibull distribution in the online durations, which is confirmed by statistical tests. The distributions of online durations of the remaining individual avatars differ from the above two types and cannot be described by a simple form. These findings have potential applications in the game industry.}
